1.  **Initial Setup & File Creation:**
    *   Create `PLAN.md` with a detailed version of this plan. (Self-referential, this step)
    *   Create `TODO.md` with a checkbox list of the plan items.
    *   Create `CHANGELOG.md` to track changes. (If it doesn't exist, otherwise prepare to append to it).

2.  **Project Definition Cleanup:**
    *   Delete `.cursor/rules/0project.mdc`.
    *   Modify `cleanup.py`:
        *   Remove the `prefix()` function and its call in `status()` and `update()` (as it reads `.cursor/rules/0project.mdc`).
        *   Update `REQUIRED_FILES` list in `cleanup.py` to remove `.cursor/rules/0project.mdc`.

3.  **Consolidate Core Logic:**
    *   Analyze `src/twat_task/__main__.py` and `src/twat_task/task.py`.
    *   If `__main__.py` is indeed redundant, delete it. Ensure any unique, useful CLI functionality from `__main__.py` (if any, though `README.md` doesn't suggest one for `twat-task` itself beyond `VideoTranscript` usage) is either moved to an appropriate place or consciously removed if not part of MVP.
    *   Adjust imports in `src/twat_task/__init__.py` if `__main__.py` is removed or its contents are moved.

4.  **Streamline `cleanup.py`:**
    *   Remove the `repomix` function from `cleanup.py`.
    *   Review and potentially simplify environment handling (e.g., rely more on `uv run`'s capabilities or `hatch run`). For now, focus on removing `repomix`.
    *   Update `ruff` and `mypy` versions in the shebang dependencies of `cleanup.py` to match `pre-commit-config.yaml` or `pyproject.toml` for consistency.

5.  **Address Linter and Type Checker Issues:**
    *   Update `pre-commit-config.yaml` with the latest versions for `ruff-pre-commit` and `pre-commit-hooks`, and a recent `mypy`.
    *   Run linters and type checkers (`ruff`, `mypy`) via pre-commit or hatch scripts.
    *   Fix reported errors in the codebase, including those indicated in the `CLEANUP.txt` log (e.g., `FBT001`, `FBT002`, `S311` from ruff; MyPy errors like `no-untyped-def`, `operator`, `prop-decorator`).

6.  **Review `examples/testprefect_example.py`:**
    *   Determine if `examples/testprefect_example.py` provides direct value to the `twat-task` MVP.
    *   If it's a generic, unrelated example, consider removing it or moving it to a separate `project_examples` directory if it's deemed useful for broader Prefect understanding but not core to this specific package. For MVP, leaning towards removal if not directly showcasing `twat-task` usage.

7.  **Update `.gitignore`:**
    *   Ensure `CLEANUP.txt` and `REPO_CONTENT.txt` (if generated by `npx repomix . -o REPO_CONTENT.txt`) are included in `.gitignore` as they are generated artifacts.
    *   Also, ensure `llms.txt` is in `.gitignore`.

8.  **Documentation & Final Review:**
    *   Update `README.md` if any CLI commands or usage patterns change significantly due to the streamlining.
    *   Ensure `TODO.md` and `PLAN.md` are updated to reflect completed tasks.
    *   Ensure `CHANGELOG.md` lists all significant changes.
    *   Run `cleanup.py status` (or its equivalent if modified) to ensure all checks pass and the repository is in a clean state.

9.  **Submit Changes:**
    *   Commit all changes with a descriptive message.
    *   Use a suitable branch name like `refactor/streamline-mvp`.
