# Repository File Catalog

This document catalogs all files and folders in the repository, includes a filesystem tree dump, and provides a brief purpose/description for each path.

## Path Descriptions

- .cursor/: Local project automation/config for assistants.
  - .cursor/rules/: Helper markdown configs and notes for cleanup/quality.
    - cleanup.mdc: Guidance to run repository cleanup/update routines.
    - filetree.mdc: Generated file tree snapshot used in tooling.
    - quality.mdc: House rules for quality and consistency.

- .git/: Git internals for version control history and refs.

- .github/: GitHub metadata/configuration.
  - .github/workflows/: GitHub Actions CI workflows.
    - push.yml: Lint + test matrix on push/PR; uses Ruff and Pytest across Python versions.
    - release.yml: Release workflow (publishing/build steps) executed on tagged releases.

- .gitignore: Ignore patterns for Git (build artifacts, venvs, caches, etc.).

- .pre-commit-config.yaml: Pre-commit hooks configuration (Ruff, MyPy, basic hygiene checks).

- CHANGELOG.md: Keep-a-Changelog formatted change history (Unreleased section present).

- CLEANUP.txt: Log-like snapshot produced by cleanup tooling showing README, statuses, etc.

- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md: Narrative summary of a proposed/partial semver + release/test setup; includes manual next steps.

- LICENSE: MIT license for the project.

- LOG.md: Additional changelog-like log with versioned historical notes and links.

- PLAN.md: High-level internal plan to streamline and clean the repository (deprecate redundant files, adjust cleanup.py, etc.).

- README.md: Main documentation. Describes the twat-task package, its goals, example usage, and development guidance.

- REPO_CONTENT.txt: Packed repository content produced by a mixing tool (repomix); used for AI/contextual analysis.

- TODO.md: Checklist aligned with PLAN.md items for actionable tracking.

- VERSION.txt: Text file with current version string used by tooling/docs.

- cleanup.py: Repository maintenance script (uv-based) to set up venv, run checks (ruff/mypy/pytest), commit/push changes, and generate logs/mixed content.

- examples/: Examples for developers.
  - examples/testprefect_example.py: Minimal Prefect example to validate local Prefect setup; not core to package API.

- llms.txt: Aggregated operations/log and compressed context for LLM analysis generated by cleanup tooling.

- pyproject.toml: Project configuration (build via Hatch, dependencies, Ruff, MyPy, Hatch env scripts, entry points, versioning via hatch-vcs).

- src/: Source root for the package.
  - src/twat_task/: Package code.
    - __init__.py: Package initialization; re-exports version and public API (VideoTranscript, tasks, flow).
    - task.py: Core logic. Prefect tasks (extract_audio_task, generate_transcript_task), flow (process_video_flow), and Pydantic model (VideoTranscript) with lazy/cached properties.

- tests/: Test suite using Pytest.
  - tests/test_flows.py: Unit tests for Prefect flow behavior using monkeypatch and MagicMock.
  - tests/test_package.py: Lightweight package import sanity checks.
  - tests/test_tasks.py: Unit tests for individual tasks; verifies file creation and timing calls (mocked sleeps).
  - tests/test_video_transcript.py: Tests for VideoTranscript model lazy evaluation and caching semantics.

## Notes and Observations

- The package exposes `__version__` via `twat_task.__version__` in `__init__.py`; ensure `src/twat_task/__version__.py` exists at runtime (hatch-vcs generates it at build; dev installs may need a fallback).
- `cleanup.py` references `.cursor/rules/0project.mdc` in REQUIRED_FILES/prefix(); that file is not present in the current repo snapshot. This will log an error in status and can be streamlined per PLAN.md recommendations.
- CI uses Ruff for both linting and formatting, MyPy for typing, and a Python matrix; local Hatch scripts mirror these checks.
